# msm-layouts
layouts app for msm-linux
using Glade GTK

## Reminder
- Maybe replace this with charm-cli, looks better tbh
- use bubbletea and lipgloss library
- learn Go-lang
- if using charm, add a section "Common configs" which will open common configs such as samba config etc etc.
- added the dependencies, all the dependencies and flatpaks
- inspiration from TUIs such as GLOW, FFF, NNN, SoftServer (Git Server)
- ```ssh git.charm.sh``` > for inspiration (also clickable by mouse)
